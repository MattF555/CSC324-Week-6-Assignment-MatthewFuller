# **Java To-Do List Application**

## **Overview**
This is a simple **To-Do List application** built in **Java**. It allows users to:
✅ **Add tasks**  
✅ **View tasks**  
✅ **Remove tasks**  
✅ **Exit the application**  
Additionally, this program **automatically**:  
✅ **Reads to the save file upon program start**  
✅ **Saves to the save file when the exit application command is done**

This project demonstrates **basic Java programming concepts**, including:
- **ArrayLists** for storing tasks
- **Loops** for handling user input
- **Methods** for modular design
- **Scanner class** for user input handling and reading the save file
- **Switch statements** for menu selection
- **FileWriter** for writing into the save file
